Accessing SQL from a Programming Language
A database programmer must have access to a general-purpose programming language for two main reasons:

1. Limited expressiveness of SQL
Not all queries can be expressed in SQL, as it lacks the full expressive power of a general-purpose programming language.

2. Non-declarative actions
Tasks such as printing reports, interacting with users, or displaying query results in a graphical user interface cannot be
performed directly within SQL.
For this laboratory work, students are required to select one of the freely available RDBMS systems online and learn how to establish a
connection to the database using a programming language. It is highly recommended to use one of the following RDBMS systems:
SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MS SQL Server.
As for the programming language, students should choose from the following options: C++, Java, C#, Python, Ruby, Go, Kotlin, Rust,
Swift, or Julia.
